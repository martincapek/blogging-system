    <h2> Brief description of the partner organisation</h2>

    <p> ESPAMOL – Escola Secundária Padre António Martins de Oliveira, it’s a public school aggregation of
        medium
        size, with about 1790 students from the pre-school up to high school (12th grade). It’s placed in the
        heart
        of western Algarve, in Lagoa, between Portimão and Silves.
        Lagoa, is a county with about 89 Km2, crossed by the principal Algarve routes (EN 125 e Via do Infante –
        A
        22) and has 6 small towns ( Lagoa, Carvoeiro, Porches, Estombar, Parchal e Ferragudo). Lagoa is the
        county
        town fill with contrasts and great landscape diversity whose natural potentiality gives much to the
        present
        economic structure.</p>
    <p> ESPAMOL is a group of schools that includes one high school, one basic school, 3 primary schools and 3
        pre-schools</p>
    <p> In the county there is also a private school that absorve most of the upper class and middle class
        students,
        therefore most of the attending students of our school come from 3 deprived social neighborhoods with
        severe
        basic needs.</p>
    <p>There are also many foreigner students that demands from the school an efford to integrate all diferent
        cultures and to maximise human resources through specific educational support for this students,
        partucularly in Portuguese language.</p>

    <p>The diversity of students and cultures are of great value to all the school aggregation and respective
        educational community.</p>

    <p>The high school ESPAMOL is the main school of the school aggregation and it’s localized on a periphery
        area,
        surround by green land and housing estate. It has a typology T33 with five building. Beside the regular
        classes it has several specific rooms, a resource center, an auditorium, a library, a sports pavilion,
        an
        open air sports area, and the administrative offices.</p>

    <p> With 25 years old, the building needs some profound remodelling to face the requirements of the modern
        times.</p>

    <p> ESPAMOL, has been developing the professional teaching for the past years, trying to face the needs and
        aspirations of the community and students. In this field of expertise it has developed courses of Sports
        management; Restaurant/Bar; Children’s care; Gardening; Aesthetic - beauty and cosmetic and Computer
        technology expertise.</p>
    <h2>Activities and Experience of the Organization</h2>

    <p>For the past four years, ESPAMOL, has been developing the Sports management Professional Course. This is
        a
        three years course that finish with a professional internship and with the presentation of a final
        project
        for their professional skills assessment test related to sports that may include the organization of a
        sports event of any kind.</p>
    <p>This course approaches several areas in sports management such as Marketing, Legislation, Planning,
        Equipment and Infrastructure Maintenance, developing projects, and so on.</p>
    <p>This project would be a perfect way for our students to develop such competences and for them to apply
        all
        of the contents that are given in the course in a real context, making the course even more appealing
        and
        meaningful.</p>

    <p> We have specialized teachers in the sports and management fields that have followed this course from the
        beginning and we have been working in partnership with Lagoa city council, the adjacent city councils of
        Portimão and Silves, and with some private business such as gymnasiums and Sport teams.</p>

    <p> We also have worked with the Regional Sports Education, supporting some regional sports events.</p>
