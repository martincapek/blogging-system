    <p>The school is located in the western suburbs of the municipality of Genova, in the north of Italy. This
        area has had a great development in the last few years. A lot of popular buildings have been built
        increasing the number of inhabitants. There are about six hundred students in the school divided in two
        parts of the town. The main seat is in a modern buiding not very far from the city centre and the
        smaller one is an old orphanage, with only five classes, in a small village, called Voltri, in front of
        the seaside.
    </p>

    <p> It is a vocational commercial, turistic and technical school. The school has organized supplementary
        activities for years in order to offer the students opportunities for deepening and enrichment that
        aren't available in the territory. We have a special need department that takes students with both
        physical and mental disabilities. The school organization is set up to give as many students as possible
        experiences that they would not otherwise have.
