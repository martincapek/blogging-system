    <p> EDUCAnet Brno school is situated in a quiet part of Brno â€“ it is the 2nd largest city and it is said to be
        one of
        the most beautiful cities in the Czech Republic. EDUCAnet Brno is a part of a secondary school network which
        consists of four other schools in different cities of the Czech Republic.
    </p>

    <p> EDUCAnet Brno is a small school with about 70 students and 12 teachers. The school provides compulsory
        education in
        the field of economics and information technology (IT) and prepares students for university studies and
        working in
        IT or economic institutions. Our students are used to working with the latest technological devices and
        gadgets. All
        our teachers incorporate innovative methodology and interesting teaching methods into their lessons. Since
        the
        school is really small, the atmosphere is very friendly. Teachers, parents and students use a unique
        e-learning
        system not only to see the study materials, check marks or attendance but they can also use it to
        communicate with
        the teachers or other students.
    </p>

    <p> Our students have also many opportunities to spend some time with their classmates even outside school as
        the school
        organizes a get-to-know course, skiing course, end-of-the-year trip and various field trips and educational
        tours in
        the Czech Republic and also abroad every year.
