    <p> The IES EL Burgo de Las Rozas is a bilingual Secondary School located in a medium-high income area in the
        Northwestern town of Las Rozas in Madrid. We have around one thousand students but try to fit the needs for all
        types of pupils. We have Excellence Programs for students with high intellectual potential, vocational studies
        in IT and qualification programs for students with risk of dropping out of school and special needs.</p>
    <p> We have bilateral exchange programs with Denmark, UK, Germany, Finland, France and India, to strengthen the
        international dimension of our school and many after school activities that include sports, music, foreign
        languages, debates and a school choir. We think that students learn best when they are happy and valued;
        supported, challenged and encouraged, so we take care to ensure our studentsâ€™ education is both enriching and
        enjoyable. Academic excellence is at the heart of our school, but we nurture equally creativity, personal and
        physical development, independence and inquiring minds. All students are individuals, and there can be no single
        pathway that all must be compelled to tread. Consequently, we endeavour to build a personal curriculum that will
        draw upon the raw talent and energy that students bring with them to help them achieve personal success. We aim
        to be truly a 21st Century school, concerned not just with what our students learn, but with how they learn, and
        how they grow in confidence, independence and critical thinking. We encourage our students to become responsible
        European citizens with cultural and international awareness.</p>
